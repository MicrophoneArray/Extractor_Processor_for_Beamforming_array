# Extractor and Processor
This extractor node subscribes to image and audio data, merging messages with similar timestamps into a new message published on `/extractor/av_message`

While processor node subscribes to the `/extractor/av_message` message, then it will publish the beam_overlay image which shows the source of the sound.

## Build
To build the project, use the following command. This avoids potential dependency errors:

`colcon build --merge-install --symlink-install --cmake-args -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic`

## Run
Original Microphone Array: launch the extractor and processor with `ros2 launch processor processor.launch.py `

Car Microphone Array: launch the extractor and processor with `ros2 launch processor processor_car.launch.py `

## Messages

### Subscription

`cae_micarray/audio/array` : the audio output of the microphone array

### Publication

`beamforming/beam_overlay_image` : the beamforming overlay image with the camera (lidar points in the future)

`beamforming/beam_image` : the beam_raw image which shows the direction of the source of the sound
